## HTML Tags - A to Z List
HTML Tags are fundamental elements used to structure and format content on web pages. They provide instructions to web browsers on how to render text, images, links, and other media.

HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but with an additional forward-slash /. The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks the end.

For example:

<p> is an opening tag for a paragraph.
</p> is the closing tag.
Some tags are self-closing, meaning they don’t require a closing tag, such as <img> and <br>.

Essential tags for defining an HTML document structure include <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.
