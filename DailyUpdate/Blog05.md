Background
This document defines formatting and style rules for HTML and CSS. It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files that use HTML and CSS, including Sass and GSS files. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.

General Formatting Rules
Indentation
Indent by 2 spaces at a time.

Donâ€™t use tabs or mix tabs and spaces for indentation.

  <li>Fantastic
  <li>Great
</ul>
.example {

}
Capitalization
Use only lowercase.

All code has to be lowercase: This applies to HTML element names, attributes, attribute values (unless text/CDATA), CSS selectors, properties, and property values (with the exception of strings).

<!-- Not recommended -->
<A HREF="/">Home</A>

Trailing white spaces are unnecessary and can complicate diffs.
